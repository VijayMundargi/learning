<br>
Today i have done payment page . Change the state of progress Bar.
<br>

 What I Worked On


1. **Payment Page**
   - Designed a detailed payment form using HTML.
   - Includes fields like name on card, phone number, expiry date, and CVV.
   - Progress bar highlights the current step as "Payment".

2. **Submission Page**
   - Contains a **progress bar only** showing all steps.
   - No additional form; used just for final visual feedback after payment.

3. **Progress Bar**
   - Implemented on all key pages to visually indicate the current step.
   - Dynamically changes style to show active or finished steps.
